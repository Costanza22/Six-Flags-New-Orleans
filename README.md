## Hurricane Katrina

Hurricane Katrina, one of the most devastating hurricanes in U.S. history, made landfall near New Orleans on August 29, 2005. The storm surge breached the levees, leading to catastrophic flooding that submerged approximately 80% of the city, including Six Flags New Orleans. The park was inundated with floodwaters, causing extensive damage to its rides, infrastructure, and facilities.
