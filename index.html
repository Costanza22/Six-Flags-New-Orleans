 <em><p>Six Flags New Orleans is an abandoned theme park located near the intersection of Interstate 10 and Interstate 510 in New Orleans.[4] It first opened as Jazzland in 2000, and a leasing agreement was established with Six Flags in 2002 following the previous operator's bankruptcy proceedings.[5] Six Flags invested $20 million in upgrades, and the park reopened as Six Flags New Orleans in 2003. It was closed eight days prior to Hurricane Katrina making landfall on August 29, 2005, and because of serious damage from flooding, the park never reopened and was left abandoned.

  <em><p>.

Six Flags salvaged several rides and relocated them to other parks. The Industrial Development Board (IDB) of New Orleans owns the property and oversees redevelopment plans. Following several failed proposals to redevelop the site, it remains abandoned and in poor condition.</p></em>
  <em><p>
    Videos and photos of the site have emerged over the years from thrill-seekers and YouTubers. As a result, city officials became more diligent in securing the park and banning tourists, tasking the New Orleans Police Department with patrolling the abandoned site and arresting trespassers. An option to demolish and clear the land was explored in 2019 following complaints from local residents, estimated to cost the city $1.3 million.In the meantime, the city continues to generate revenue from the property by occasionally leasing the park to various production companies as a filming location.

Themed areas within Jazzland / Six Flags New Orleans
Tom and Dian Winingder spent almost ten years arranging the partnership that would open Jazzland. In 1995, the developers solicited a loan from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), initially in the amount of $15 million, to complete the park.The partners included Burroughs & Chapin located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which withdrew in 1997, and Ogden Corporation, which sold its theme park division to Alfa Alfa for $148 million in March 2000.The park is built on a concrete deck 4 ft (1.2 m) thick. </p></em>
<em><p>Jazzland (2000–2002)
      .</p></em>
      <em><p>The park opened under the name Jazzland on May 20, 2000; the crowd was estimated at 20–25,000 people, and 75–80,000 season passes had been sold.It was operated by Alfa SmartParks, a Greek holding company that purchased the Odgen Entertainment theme park division; the company has since changed hands and now is known as Palace Entertainment, owned by the Spanish company Parques Reunidos. The original themed areas were Mardi Gras, Pontchartrain Beach, Cajun Country, Jazz Plaza, Kids' Carnival, and The Goodtime Gardens; the first season ran until October 29, with season passes available for $89.99 (individual) or $219.96 (family of four).Rides included Mega Zeph, a wooden roller coaster track built on a steel frame to prevent termite infestation and withstand hurricane-force winds.Mega Zeph was inspired by the old Zephyr roller coaster at the closed Pontchartrain Beach Amusement Park that was next to Lake Pontchartrain by the University of New Orleans. The intent was to rebuild the Zephyr, but it was a smaller roller coaster, so that idea was scrapped in favor of the current larger Mega Zeph. Other rides included a junior steel coaster called Rex's Rail Runner, a wild mouse steel coaster, and a common steel shuttle looping Vekoma boomerang rollercoaster called Zydeco Scream.[16] The park had a log flume called Cypress Plunge and a splashwater falls ride called Spillway Splashout.[16] In addition, the park had common amusement park spinning rides and a carousel merry-go-round.

The park was not profitable, as Alfa SmartParks specialized in running water parks and smaller amusement arcade centers.</p></em>

      <em><p>Six Flags spent $20 million to upgrade the park and reopened it in April 2003 under the name Six Flags New Orleans.[20] Six Flags added more shaded areas and many new flat spinning rides. The park was renamed Six Flags, and the "it's playtime!" theme was adopted that included a dancing old man, Mr. Six. They added a Bolliger & Mabillard inverted coaster named Batman: The Ride (a mirrored version of the B&M Batman: The Ride coaster model) relocated from the defunct Thrill Valley in Japan, and a Vekoma multiple looping coaster called The Jester relocated from Six Flags Fiesta Texas. A water park that would be included in the admission (like Six Flags Parks such as Six Flags St. Louis and Six Flags America, for example) was in the planning stages in early 2005 and was going to be announced at the end of August. However, Hurricane Katrina was about to strike New Orleans, which put those plans and the continued operations of the park in question.

The last day the park operated was Sunday August 21, 2005, eight days before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Weekday operations had ended a couple of weeks earlier, however, as schools start early in August in the New Orleans area and end in mid-May. The park was scheduled to reopen for the weekend on August 27 or August 28, but once Katrina was forecast late on Friday, August 26 to directly hit New Orleans, the weekend re-opening was cancelled in order to prepare for the storm and begin evacuations. By the time the park closed in 2005, Six Flags had spent $44 M on park upgrades.</p></em>
      <em><p>
           Because the park was located next to Lake Pontchartrain, the park installed drainage pipes to protect it from flooding. On the morning of August 29, 2005, just after sunrise, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans, resulting in 1,464 deaths and over $100 billion in damages.[21][22] As many as 26,000 city residents took shelter at the Louisiana Superdome,[23] and over 80% of New Orleans was flooded.[24]

Water from Lake Pontchartrain overflowed and overwhelmed the drainage system at Six Flags New Orleans, which was unable to keep up with the flow of water, flooding the theme park for the duration of Katrina. In the storm's aftermath, the park was left submerged 6 feet (1.8 m) deep, taking over a month for the water to leave the park and leaving devastation in its wake.
      </p></em>
            <em><p>
              The park grounds are located on a low-lying section of Eastern New Orleans, with a 6-foot (1.8 m) earthen flood berm running along the perimeter, creating an artificial basin. As such, this area was heavily flooded in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. After the park's drainage pumps failed during the storm, the berm retained the combination of rainwater and sea water overflow from Lake Pontchartrain caused by Katrina's massive storm surge, submerging the entire park grounds in corrosive, brackish floodwater to a depth of 4 to 7 feet (1.2 to 2.1 m) for over a month. Due to the extensive water and wind damage sustained, the park was closed indefinitely without plans to reopen.
            </em></p>

            <em><p>
              Initial damage reports by Six Flags inspectors stated that the park buildings, the flat rides (except for one that was being serviced off-site at the time of the storm) and attractions were 80% destroyed by long term salt-water immersion and both the wooden track and steel superstructure of the Mega Zeph were likely damaged beyond repair. The only large ride to escape relatively unscathed was the Batman: The Ride roller-coaster, due to its elevated station platform and corrosion-resistant support structure.
            </p></em>
            <em><p>

              On July 1, 2006, having announced that the park would be closed "at least" through 2007, Six Flags announced that it had concluded its damage assessments and declared the park to be an "effective total loss"—with no desire or intent by the company to undertake the prohibitive cost of rebuilding—and was in negotiations with the City of New Orleans to make an early exit from the 75-year lease that Six Flags entered into on the property in 2002.[25] However, then-Mayor Ray Nagin said he planned to hold Six Flags to the lease agreement and force them to rebuild. If held to the terms of the lease agreement, Six Flags would have been legally obligated to rebuild the park on the same site, but only to the extent of the insurance money Six Flags received. Six Flags determined the value of assets destroyed by the storm at $32.5 million. As of September 2006, Six Flags had collected $11.5 million of insurance proceeds, bringing the insurance receivable balance to $24.4 million.[26] In January 2007, Six Flags officials revealed to the New Orleans Times-Picayune that the company was suing its insurers for the remaining $17.5 million in coverage.

<em><p>In April 2008, Southern Star Amusement Inc. proposed to take over the site lease from the then-owner Six Flags, promising to expand the park to over 60 rides (more than double its pre-Katrina size), complete a water park that Six Flags had been planning, and add an RV park.[35] Southern Star Amusement Inc. pledged to open the park as Legend City Adventure Park, with 60 rides in place, including a new water park by the summer of 2009 if the city approved the lease takeover, with the campground to follow. One issue concerning rebuilding was Six Flags' continued removal of infrastructure from the park. In a quarterly conference call Six Flags discussed plans to remove the S&S Towers by 2009 with more ride removals to follow. Items from existing Jazzland rides, such as Mega Zeph's trains and Spillway Splashout's boats, were sent to other parks. On September 27, 2008, Southern Star stated on its website that it would no longer be trying to revive Six Flags New Orleans.</p></em>
      <em><p>
        In February 2009, Southern Star was taking another look at the park and considering a takeover bid with the City of New Orleans. Southern Star planned a scaled down effort, with intentions only to reopen the park with a water park added within the existing midway area. The idea was to reopen and build incrementally, saving about $50 million in improvements for the next few years. Given the poor economic situation at the time, this plan seemed to be the only way that the park could be saved. The basic idea was to use investors and Go Zone Bonds to raise the $35 to $40 million needed to just reopen the park with basic improvements that are needed to make a real recovery and profit. Southern Star's CEO Danny R. Rogers asked that Six Flags stop all removal action of equipment from the park, as the equipment in question belongs to the City of New Orleans and not Six Flags. The return of other equipment taken from the park by Six Flags was also requested.

On August 18, 2009, it was announced that the land would be redeveloped into a Nickelodeon Universe theme/water park.

            <em><p>
              On September 18, 2009, the city of New Orleans fined Six Flags $3 million and ordered the company to vacate its lease with the park.[37] On June 13, 2009, Six Flags filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The City of New Orleans took ownership of the park shortly after.

As of early 2010, the site was overgrown with debris and weeds. Removal of the debris and underbrush had begun.

As of April 11, 2010, the site was still shut down with no clear future, since the city of New Orleans owned the property by this time and the plans for the Nickelodeon-branded theme park fell through three months after bonds failed to come through.

In August 2011, The City of New Orleans called for proposals for redevelopment ideas for the site. Eight entrepreneurs stepped forward to suggest turning the property into a power plant, a theme park, or even an outlet mall. On November 29, 2011, the city of New Orleans chose two of the proposed projects: an outlet mall and a green theme park.[40] On February 6, 2012, it was reported that the selection committee rejected the plan for the site of Six Flags New Orleans to become a theme park, leaving the upscale outlet mall as the only proposal being considered by the committee.[41] Despite the committee's actions, one of the original eight entrepreneurs continued to try to get public support for their Jazzland Park proposal, which includes the addition of a water park and movie studio back lot.

            SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D (also known as SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D Ride, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Ride or SpongeBob SquarePants 3-D) is a cel-shaded 4-D movie simulator based on the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants.

      </td>
      <td>
            The ride once appeared at Camp Snoopy in the Mall of America as a movie rotation of The Mystery Mine Ride. Instead of being in 4-D with special effects, the ride was in 3-D and the seats would move (causing a very realistic crash during the Rock Bottom sequence). In the fall of 2007, the Mystery Mine Ride, which was formerly home to SpongeBob SquarePants: The Ride, was demolished to make way for the SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge roller coaster, part of the park's transformation into Nickelodeon Universe.

      <td>
            The film opens with Painty the Pirate about to sing the television series theme song as usual, but instead he walks out of the painting and throws the riders into Bikini Bottom. The audience ends up at the Krusty Krab, where SpongeBob SquarePants welcomes them and shows them how to make a Krabby Patty by pointing out the ingredients with his spatula.
      </td>
      <td>
         While preparing the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob accidentally loses a pickle. The pickle then jumps out of the restaurant into Patrick Star's hand, as he rides on a pogo stick. Patrick then steals the pickle, and SpongeBob, not knowing why, tells the riders to meet Patrick on his bubble bike, destroying half of Bikini Bottom. While traversing Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob plummets down the vertical road in Rock Bottom, where a fish bursts the bubble bike by biting it.
      </td>
      
      <td>The force of the pop snags SpongeBob in the air, landing in the Chum Bucket, where Plankton holds the real Patrick hostage, revealing that the pickle thief was a robotic version of Patrick. The robot then chases after SpongeBob, only to be shut down by Patrick (looking for an electrical outlet for his toaster oven). Plankton is crushed by his robot and SpongeBob retrieves the pickle. Sandals enters the Chum Bucket for his hamburger; however, he tells SpongeBob that he ordered his Krabby Patty without pickles, before abruptly exploding, leaving only his head and feet. He then explains to him that he is allergic to pickles and walks away as SpongeBob jokes, "Well, that was pickle-culiar!"</td>

      Hurricane Katrina was a tropical storm that reached Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on land and Category 5 in the Atlantic Ocean. Hurricane winds reached more than 280 km/h, and caused extensive damage in the coastal region of the southern United States, especially around the New Orleans metropolitan area, on August 28, 2005 where more than one million people were evacuated. . The hurricane passed through southern Florida, causing around two billion dollars in damage and causing 1836 direct deaths. It was the 11th named storm of 2005, and fourth among hurricanes.</td>

      <td> Hurricane Katrina caused approximately 1800 deaths, making it the third deadliest hurricane and one of the most destructive to ever hit the United States. The hurricane crippled much US oil and natural gas extraction, as much of the US oil is extracted in the Gulf of Mexico.</td>

      <td>According to the National Hurricane Center of the United States, NOAA, which issued a report on August 23 that it had formed a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas, beginning the meteorological history of Hurricane Katrina. On the 24th it evolved into a tropical storm and on the 25th it approached Aventura, Florida.

Katrina weakened on August 26 after making landfall, becoming a Category 2 with winds of about 100 miles per hour (about 160 km/h) heading toward Mississippi and Louisiana. On August 27, it evolved to Category 3 with hurricane strength and on the 28th it went to Category 4, in the early afternoon Katrina intensified rapidly with winds of 175 mph (281 km/h) surpassing the starting point of Category 5 with pressure of 902 mph (hPa), making it the most intense hurricane in the Atlantic basin. On August 29, Katrina hit Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama.
On August 29, Katrina's storm surge caused 53 different hotspots in Greater New Orleans, submerging eighty percent of the city. A June 2007 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers indicated that two-thirds of flooding was caused by multiple failures in the city's barriers. The gates that were not closed were not mentioned.</td>

  More than seventy countries have pledged cash or other assistance. Notably, Cuba and Venezuela (both hostile to the US government) were the first countries to offer aid, pledging more than $1 million, several mobile hospitals, water treatment plants, canned food, mineral water, heating oil, 1100 doctors and 26.4 tons of medication. However, this aid was rejected by the US authorities.[3][4][5][6] Kuwait made the largest single cash donation, US$500 million; other major donations were made by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (each donated US$100 million), South Korea (US$30 million), Australia (US$10 million), India and China (US$5 million each), New Zealand ($2 million), Pakistan ($1.5 million), and Bangladesh ($1 million).[7] India sent tarps, blankets and hygiene kits. An Indian Air Force IL-76 plane delivered 25 tons of supplies to victims of Hurricane Katrina at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas, on September 13, 2005. Several of the countries mentioned above were still recovering from the damage caused by the devastating Tsunami from the previous year.
